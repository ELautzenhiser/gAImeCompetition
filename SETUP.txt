SETUP.txt - The frameworks for this repository need to be installed and setup
before the application can be run.  Follow these instructions to get the
repository ready to go.

==============
Install Python
==============

If you don't already have Python 3, make sure it is installed and is at least
version 3.4.  You can download the latest version at www.python.org.

============================
Create a virtual environment
============================

We use a virtual environment so that all packages will be contained in our
project directory:

    python3 -m venv venv

or on windows...

    py -3 -m venv venv

and then activate the environment:

    . venv/bin/activate

or on windows...

    venv\Scripts\activate

========================
Install all dependencies
========================

First, make sure pip is up-to-date:

    pip3 install --upgrade pip

Then use pip3 to install the deqendencies specified in requirements.txt:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

=========
Run Flask
=========

First, make sure the environment variables FLASK_APP and FLASK_ENV are set:

Linux/Mac:
    export FLASK_APP=gaime-competition
    expost FLASK_ENV=development

Windows:
    set FLASK_APP=gaime-competition
    set FLASK_ENV=development

Then, enter the following at the command prompt:
    flask run

In a browser, visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/hello. If your localhost address is
different, enter that address instead of 127.0.0.1:5000.

You should see 'Hello, World!'.

EXTRAS

If you don't like cd'ing to the top directory in order to run flask, you can
install this package using the following command:

    pip3 install -e .
