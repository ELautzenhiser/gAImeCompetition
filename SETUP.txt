SETUP.txt - The frameworks for this repository need to be installed and setup
before the application can be run.  Follow these instructions to get the
repository ready to go.

==============
Install Python
==============

If you don't already have Python 3, make sure it is installed and is at least
version 3.4.  You can download the latest version at www.python.org.

============================
Create a virtual environment
============================

We use a virtual environment so that all packages will be contained in our
project directory:

    python3 -m venv venv

or on windows...

    py -3 -m venv venv

and then activate the environment:

    . venv/bin/activate

or on windows...

    venv\Scripts\activate

========================
Install all dependencies
========================

First, make sure pip is up-to-date:

    pip3 install --upgrade pip

Then use pip3 to install the deqendencies specified in requirements.txt:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
