<b>The Project</b>

This is a project aimed towards hosting competitions between AI (or if-statement based) programs in games like poker or chess. Build and submit your program to see how it does against others.

<b>How to Play</b>

Take a look at the available games and choose one to play.Then, write a player to compete. Right now, we support players coded in Python 3, with more languages being worked on. An unpublished player can compete, but does not win or lose any points - it's an opportunity to make sure there aren't any bugs and make small tweaks. Once a player is published, it will earn points for wins and penalized points for losses. A published player can be challenged for competition at any time by another player. If you want to replace your player with a new and improved version, simply retire the old one. You'll keep any points accrued, but it won't be able to battle anymore.
